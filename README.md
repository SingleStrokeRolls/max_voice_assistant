# Home Assistant Based on RasPi and ESP32

This project demonstrates the integration of **Raspberry Pi (RasPi)** and **ESP32** to build a home assistant system that conducts text-to-speech interactions using ARKs from **Baidu** and **Volcengine**. The Raspberry Pi is responsible for the core processing, while the ESP32 handles audio input and output via **MicroPython** and communicates with the Raspberry Pi for smooth interaction.

## Features

- **Raspberry Pi (RasPi)** is used to manage text-to-speech interactions and processing using ARKs from Baidu and Volcengine.
- **ESP32** is programmed with **MicroPython** to handle audio input/output and communicate with the Raspberry Pi.
- Communication between the RasPi and ESP32 ensures seamless interaction for voice-based commands.

## Acknowledgments

- **Baidu** and **Volcengine** for their text-to-speech ARKs.
- **MicroPython** for providing an easy-to-use platform for programming the ESP32.
